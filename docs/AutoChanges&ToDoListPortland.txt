Things changed:

1. Fixed Intake Req Event Posting to initialize start time on eject note
2. Added motor velocity to intake event records. 
	Note: Motor speed is .9 percent output, but we don't know actual velocity.
	
   Have a 10:1 gearbox followed by 18:24 timing belt pulleys. If motor speed is
   5000 RPM that is 500 ROM * .75 / 60 = 6.25 RPS. WITH pulley dia 
   of 1.5" = 4.7123889 inches circumference, the eject belt speed will be about 29 in/sec.
   A timeout of 500 ms to eject 11" of note seems reasonable.
3. Changed EjectNote timeout to 500 ms (instead of 1000 ms)
4. Removed 300 ms delays after wheels are ready to shoot, before shooting,
   in both ScoreIndexedShotCmd and ScoreDistantShotCmd
5. Deletedmd (commented out) DefaultIntakeCmd in MaasterArmController
6. Made deployIntake and MoveCenNoteToRightNotePosCmd parallel insead of sequential
   in ScoreMultipleNotesAuto
7. Already left shooter wheels spun up through auto
8. Need to test 2 Note Auto from Left and Right sides to ensure they finish in 15 Seconds
9. Try to retract intake directly to PrepForDistantShotPos when in Auto mode and
   Score multipleNoteAuto (use a flag, and issue PrepForDistantShot when InnerArm is
   vertical.
   Saves at least two moves per shot, and also the wait for aim and spin up to distant
   shot speed happen in parallel with first move. After that, the shooter components
   remain in distant mode until the end of autonomous.
